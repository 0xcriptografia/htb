`./run.sh` <br>

this container is intended to run when participating on http://hackthebox.eu/
challenges, it exports X on Linux systems for now, OSX support will be available
shortly. <br>

when connected to hackthebox vpn its possible to be hacked backwards, so the
idea here is to use a safe environment when doing the challenges, in case of
being owned, just the container gets compromised, not the host system. <br>

Also to have an environment which can be easily configured, spin up and re-created whenever
needed, and docker is just perfect for this. <br>

your PR's are mostly welcomed, please submit your ideas on how to improve this
project.
